# General

I've started with initializing both client and server application. Firstly I developed the front-end application to test UI with some mock data.

# Front-end

Started with creating 3 pages (Home, Dashboard, About) and routing to them. Created Header component to route between the pages. In Dashboard component I used Material UI x-charts to generate line graph and added 2 more components Item and ItemsList to generate the table of the data. Filled up Home and About pages with some text. Created a button "Analyze by" on Dashboard component to see graph of the specific value by toggling it.

# Back-end

Created a service, entity and controller. I've used the static hard coded data in my server application just for anybody's to test it out.

# Integration

On the client application changed the static hard coded data to the data from server application.
